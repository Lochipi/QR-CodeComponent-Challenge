## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It has been a challenge for me to center elements and also making sites responsive, but after I have done this I have improved my understanding on flexbox and grid positioning and making sites responsive.

### Continued development
I would like to learn more about Animation.

### Useful resources

- [Reference Resourse MdnDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for my references on CSS properties. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
